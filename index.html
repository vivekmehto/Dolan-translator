        <p>Dolan is a sociopathic duck in a series called "The Uncle Dolan Show". The language used by the
            characters in
            the Dolan show could be likened to LOLcat speak, but where the misspelling are much more severe, and
            tend to
            look like they were produced by a child who has only just started to learn how to spell. This dolan
            translator tries to be somewhat faithful to the YouTube series in the different spellings of words, but
            since the spellings aren't at all consistent in the Dolan show, I figured I could have some license to
            tweak
            the spelling here and there.</p>
