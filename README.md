# Dolan Translator
Dolan is a sociopathic duck in a series called "The Uncle Dolan Show". The language used by the characters in the Dolan show could be likened to LOLcat speak, but where the misspelling are much more severe, and tend to look like they were produced by a child who has only just started to learn how to spell. This dolan translator tries to be somewhat faithful to the YouTube series in the different spellings of words, but since the spellings aren't at all consistent in the Dolan show, I figured I could have some license to tweak the spelling here and there.
